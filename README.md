# City-Builder-Cplusplus-Project
A little city builder game written from scratch using C++ and OpenGL, it was inspired by Sim City 4, and mostly is a proof of concept on whether I could parallelize the simulation in a city builder by using a copy of the data to operate on and update every "cycle". Turns out, yes, it seems to scale nicely. It lacks textures and pathfinding, so it is not playable, but you can place smokestacks by pressing W and clicking, and parks by pressing E and clicking, or create pollution by pressing Q. Pollution naturally dissipates, but also spreads. The tile colors is affected by the land value and the pollution value. All in all, we are talking about over a million squares being updated around 250 times a second based on themselves and their neighbors using my old 5820k. While the game loop is 100% original and the thread pool code has almost no copied parts, the OpenGL renderer is a heavly modified version of The Cherno's OpenGL renderer from his C++ YouTube series, a great tutorial on buffers and binding and shaders ins and outs.
